    "#### **Key Stakeholders**\n",
    "The stakeholders include the client's company executives, sales and marketing team, product management team, logistics and supply chain team, IT and data team, getINNOtized and external stakeholders(investors and suppliers)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Success Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of this project will be measured by the ability to deliver a detailed and actionable business intelligence report that answers the client's questions and provides insights for driving sales and efficiency. The report should be clear, visually appealing, and easy to understand, providing the client with a solid foundation for making data-driven decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Constraints and Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Quality: Ensure the data is clean, accurate, and complete before analysis.\n",
    "- Timeliness: The analysis and report should be delivered within the agreed-upon timeframe.\n",
    "- Client Collaboration: Regular communication with the client to understand their needs and provide updates on progress.\n",
    "- Tool Selection: Utilize appropriate data analysis and visualization tools to generate insights and present findings effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Requirements**\n",
    "- Utilize data that was collected for each month in the entire year of 2019. The data for the first half of the year (January to June) was collected in excel and saved as csv files before management decided to use databases to store their data for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<i>NB</i>** Additionally, categorize products based on their unit prices:\n",
    "- Products with unit prices above $99.99 should be labeled as high-level products.\n",
    "- Products with unit prices $99.99 and below should be labeled as basic-level products.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Business Impact**\n",
    "- Enhance customer satisfaction through better product availability.\n",
    "- Optimize inventory management, leading to cost savings and improved operational efficiency.\n",
