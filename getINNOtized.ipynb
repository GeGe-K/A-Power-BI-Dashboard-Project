The report should be clear, visually appealing, and easy to understand, providing the client with a solid foundation for making data-driven decisions.\n",

    "- Utilize data that was collected for each month in the entire year of 2019. The data for the first half of the year (January to June) was collected in excel and saved as csv files before management decided to use databases to store their data for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<i>NB</i>** Additionally, categorize products based on their unit prices:\n",
    "- Products with unit prices above $99.99 should be labeled as high-level products.\n",
